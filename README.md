# NS-SHAFT Game Project

## Project Overview

NS-SHAFT is a modern web-based recreation of a classic endless descending platformer. The player controls a character who must continually drop down a deep, never-ending shaft by landing on a series of platforms. The game features:

- Simple left/right controls to position the character as they fall
- Various platform types (normal, spike, collapsing, conveyor, spring)
- Health system where landing on platforms restores health and hitting hazards reduces it
- Power-ups that provide temporary benefits (invincibility, slow fall, health boost)
- Increasing difficulty as the player's score rises
- Mobile-friendly controls for touch devices

## Current Implementation

The game is built with React and TypeScript, using HTML Canvas for rendering. Key components include:

- Game engine with physics, collision detection, and platform generation
- Character controls for keyboard and touch input
- Health and scoring systems
- Visual effects and feedback
- Responsive design that works across devices

## Next Steps

### 1. Firebase Authentication

We'll implement user authentication to allow players to:
- Create accounts and log in
- Save their progress and high scores
- Track their performance over time
- Participate in multiplayer games

Implementation plan:
- Set up Firebase project and configure authentication
- Create login/signup screens
- Implement authentication state management
- Add user profile functionality
- Store user data (scores, settings) in Firestore

### 2. Multiplayer Competitive Mode

Transform NS-SHAFT into a battle royale-style competitive game where multiple players compete simultaneously:

#### Core Multiplayer Features
- Real-time multiplayer with 10-99 players in separate shafts
- Player-to-player interaction through attack and defense mechanics
- Last-player-standing victory condition

#### Attack Mechanics
- Send hazards to opponents when landing on platforms or avoiding spikes
- Targeting system (random or strategic)
- Different attack types (extra spikes, faster scroll speed, etc.)

#### Defense Mechanics
- Combo system to clear incoming hazards
- Defensive power-ups
- Strategic platform navigation

#### Enhanced Power-Up System
- Expanded power-up types with multiplayer effects
- Temporary invincibility
- Attack boosters
- Hazard clearance

#### Visual Feedback
- Real-time player count
- Incoming attack warnings
- Targeting indicators
- Health and status of other players

#### Leaderboards and Events
- Global and friend leaderboards
- Time-limited tournaments
- Seasonal events with rewards

#### Customization
- Character appearance options
- Shaft themes and colors
- Unlockable cosmetics

#### Technical Requirements
- Real-time synchronization using Firebase Realtime Database
- Optimized networking for low-latency gameplay
- Scalable backend to handle concurrent games
- Mobile-optimized UI for multiplayer interactions

## Implementation Priority

1. Firebase Authentication setup
2. Basic user profiles and score tracking
3. Core multiplayer infrastructure
4. Attack and defense mechanics
5. Enhanced power-up system
6. Visual feedback and UI improvements
7. Leaderboards and events
8. Customization options

This roadmap will transform NS-SHAFT from a single-player experience into an engaging multiplayer competitive game while maintaining the core gameplay that makes it fun.
