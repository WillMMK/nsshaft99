1. Fix the Canvas Error
Check GameCanvas.tsx: Open this file and go to line 142, column 6, where the canvas error occurs. Look for:
Canvas Initialization: Ensure the canvas element is correctly created and its context (e.g., getContext('2d')) is accessed only after the canvas is mounted in the DOM.
Dimensions: Verify that width="273" height="492" matches your intended game resolution and that these values are set before rendering begins.
DOM Mounting: Confirm the canvas is properly added to the DOM. If you’re using React, ensure it’s rendered within a component and not unmounted unexpectedly.
Error Details: If the logs provide a specific error message (e.g., "Cannot read property of null"), it might indicate the canvas or its context isn’t available when accessed. Add checks to prevent this.
2. Review the Game Loop Logic
Inspect useGameLoop.ts: This hook likely controls the game loop. Check if:
The loop resets the game state (e.g., character position) on each iteration instead of updating it.
There’s an error handler or condition that forces a restart when the canvas fails.
Update, Don’t Reset: Ensure the loop calls an update function (e.g., to move the character) rather than reinitializing everything. For example, the character’s position should change based on input or physics, not revert to (124.5, 222).
Check GameEngine: If engine.ts manages the loop or state, verify it’s not triggering a reset after each cycle.
3. Integrate the Camera Properly
Camera Logic: Confirm the camera is tied to the character’s position and updates correctly. In GameCanvas.tsx or engine.ts, check how the camera offsets the rendering coordinates. If the game resets before rendering, the camera won’t appear to work.
Test Without Reset: Once the loop stops restarting, ensure the camera follows the character as it moves.
Debugging Tips
Add Logs: In useGameLoop.ts, log the character’s position and camera’s position after each update to see if they change.
Breakpoints: Use your IDE to step through the loop and see where it fails or resets.
Isolate the Issue: Temporarily disable the camera code to see if the loop still restarts. If it stops, the camera integration might need adjustment.
